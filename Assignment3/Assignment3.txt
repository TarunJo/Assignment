1. explaing the architecture of nodejs
=>
call stack  -> node api   -> callback queue --
(syncronus)   (asyncronus)                    |
    ^                                         |
     -----------------------------------------


2. explain the feature of nodejs like non-blocking, synchronous, single threaded.
=>
non-blocking :- does not block complete code if error happens and run it.
synchronous :- does not wait for a peice of code to run if it takes time.
single threaded:- have only one call\main stack so it is single threaded.

3. create a array and object in javascript and print it.
=> 
const arr= new Array("saab", "volvo", "BMW"); 
const arr2= [];
arr2[4]=5;
console.log(arr);
console.log(arr2);


4. Nowadays how data is transferred between server and client?(explain about json)
=>
To define JSON, we can say it is a text-based, lightweight, and human-readable format
for data exchange between clients and servers. JSON is derived from JavaScript and bears 
a close resemblance to JavaScript objects, but it is not dependent on JavaScript.


5. write program to show how to append, pop and sort elements in array in javascript.
=>
const arr=[];
arr[0]=5;
arr[2]=6;
arr.pop();
arr[4]=8;
arr.sort();


6. why should we use let in place of var in our javascript programs?
=>
var has global scope so it is not sutable for memory management and it is also
have security issues due to it's scope where as, let has local scope which is much better.


7. explain about all the primitive data types in javascript.
=>
JavaScript has seven types. Types are values that JavaScript can have:

Number
String
Boolean
Undefined
Null
